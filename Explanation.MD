# Explanation of code

The code starts off with gathering your API Key. It gathers it from an environmental variable if you have it stored in one, or if you don't, it asks you to copy/paste it into the terminal so you have the key in the program.

Then, the code asks you for the code 


# Features to add
A piece of code which will validate if your API key is a real key or not. Could not find documentation for this, so I was unable to implement it.

# Current Bugs
Sometimes, you get the error 'no module named quandl' if you run it from your terminal. The only fix I was able to find that worked for me was to run it from a code editor. I used Spyder from conda, and it worked fine for me.

Other than that, there are none right now! Yay!
